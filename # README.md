<p>Our idea when creating this project was to do a double job: on the one hand, preparing women to be part of the world of technology through excellent training that allows them to work and access jobs that until now belonged exclusively to the men; on the other hand, giving awareness talks in companies, both at the management level and at the employee level, so that the adaptation to this new situation of diversity within the workplace is careful, accepted by everyone.</p>
